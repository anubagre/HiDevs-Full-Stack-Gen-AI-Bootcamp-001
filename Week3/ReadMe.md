**Problem Statement 1:**

**Title:** Managing Personal Information with Python

a) Write a class which takes input from the console name of the person, and his/her date of birth. Then when the person’ name is typed it should display the dob.
b) Some persons' dob are secret so those should not be displayed, but will be stored. If a secret person's name is entered then you should just display “secret”. 
However all the data should be persisted, and loaded. We can add to the list. What data structure would you create for this problem?

**Problem Statement 2:**

**Title:** Compact Address Book Management

a) Create an addressBook class  as follows: Fname, LName, StreetAddress, City, State, Country, Mobile, email.
